# Ux-Website-1
This is html code for a simple website I built using html, css and javascript.
Through this code, you can see the breakdown of css and the use of classes. The website is started by initializing html, head, meta and then title. from there, our style tab in html implements our css and javascript code. Elements in html such as "strong" and "break" allow for bolding of words and breaking up of paragraphs/ spaces.

This code is fairly easy to follow, but for any suggestions or updates, please send me a pull request!
